# Sudoku-Solver
The Sudoku Solver efficiently solves 9x9 puzzles using a backtracking algorithm. It finds empty cells, tries numbers 1-9, checks validity, and backtracks when needed. Features include instant solving, optimized recursion, and easy input handling. Future upgrades may include a GUI, larger grids, and a Sudoku generator. ðŸš€
